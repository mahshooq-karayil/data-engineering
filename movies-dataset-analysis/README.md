# Movies Dataset Analysis

An analysis of a movies dataset using Jupyter Notebook to extract insights and trends.

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a movies dataset utilizing Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis encompasses data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and effective data visualization to derive key insights and trends.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Utilized for cleaning, preprocessing, and handling missing values in the dataset.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Employed for effective data visualization to present findings.

## Project Files

- **Data_Cleaning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- **Data_Merging.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for merging and handling dataset operations.
- **EDA_Visualisation.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis, extracting insights, and visualizing trends.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Pandas and NumPy to ensure data quality, handle missing values, and remove duplicates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Employed EDA techniques to derive key insights, analyze trends, and visualize patterns in the movies dataset.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Presented findings through effective data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:
   - `Data_Cleaning.ipynb`
   - `Data_Merging.ipynb`
   - `EDA_Visualisation.ipynb`

2. Follow the notebooks in the mentioned order to understand the analysis steps and findings.
