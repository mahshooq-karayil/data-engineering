# Movies Dataset Analysis

Analyzed a movies dataset using Jupyter Notebook to extract insights and trends.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of a movies dataset using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to derive key insights and visualize trends.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for handling missing values and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed for creating effective data visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Used for enhancing the aesthetics of data visualizations.

## Key Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Pandas and NumPy libraries to ensure data quality, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
- Employed exploratory data analysis techniques to derive key insights, analyze trends, and visualize patterns.
- Presented findings through effective data visualization techniques with the help of Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`).
2. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file in this repository.
3. Follow along with the analysis, code, and visualizations to understand the insights and trends extracted from the movies dataset.
