# F1 Race Dataset Analysis using PySpark

An analysis of F1 race data involving preprocessing of raw data and analyzing race results, driver standings, and constructor standings using PySpark on Databricks.

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging PySpark, a powerful distributed data processing library, to preprocess raw F1 race data and perform comprehensive analysis. The analysis encompasses race results, driver standings, and constructor standings, providing valuable insights into the world of Formula 1.

## Key Features

- Utilized PySpark for efficient preprocessing and analysis of the F1 race dataset.
- Processed and cleaned raw data to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Analyzed race results to identify trends and performance patterns.
- Studied driver standings to determine the leading drivers throughout the seasons.
- Examined constructor standings to identify the top-performing teams.
